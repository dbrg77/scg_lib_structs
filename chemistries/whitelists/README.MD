# Whitelists

## Whitelist csv file

Naming convention follows the same rule as the `shortname` key for the `definitions.json`. Please refer to README above.

Whitelist files have to be in csv format with a header. The only required header is "whitelist".

Example with the 10x v3 feature barcoding mapping file:

```
whitelist,feature_barcoding_map
AAACCCAAGAAACACT,AAACCCATCAAACACT
AAACCCAAGAAACCAT,AAACCCATCAAACCAT
AAACCCAAGAAACCCA,AAACCCATCAAACCCA
```
